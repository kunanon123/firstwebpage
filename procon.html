    <h3 ALIGN=center> <em>Pros</em></h3>
    <p><strong>1.Making new friends</strong>One of the main and most exciting advantages of foreign exchange is meeting new friends. Not only will you have an opportunity to meet different people from all over the world, but you’ll also have a special bond because a lot of them will be foreign exchange students, too. Additionally, you may have a host family who will welcome you into their home and treat you like a family member.</p>
    <p><strong>2.Learning a new language</strong>Once you’ve arrived in a new country, you’ll be surrounded by a new language that you’ll have to learn. Although it may be difficult at first, you’ll be completely immersed in the community, which is a major advantage when it comes to learning a foreign language. It goes without saying that such an opportunity doesn’t come that often.</p>
     <p><strong>3.Educational diversity</strong>Studying abroad will open up new educational opportunities for you. Apart from getting to know a completely different educational system, you’ll have a range of study options. You can expand your existing knowledge, acquire new skills and broaden your interests. In addition, you’ll have more options when it comes programs, so make sure to research colleges before making the final decision.</p>
     <p><strong>4.Innovation</strong>The field of education is always open to change, implementing new techniques and approaches and providing students with new possibilities. Pushing the boundaries of innovation, this field aims at making students’ lives easier and more fulfilled. For example, innovative student accommodation in Melbourne is scheduled to open in 2018 after its success in Sydney and Brisbane. By studying abroad, you have an opportunity to be a part of those changes and reap the benefits that they offer.</p>
     <h3 ALIGN=center> <em>Cons</em></h3>
    <p><strong>1.Culture shock</strong>While traveling and exploring a new country is always fun, living in it might be quite challenging, especially if the country is completely different from yours. Apart from not knowing the language, you’ll be faced with unfamiliar and strange customs, different beliefs and mentality, which can be overwhelming.</p>
    <p><strong>2.Loneliness and homesickness</strong>Although foreign exchange provides you with an opportunity to meet new people, you may feel lonely and homesick because you’ll leave all of your loved ones behind. Despite being surrounded with people, you may be overwhelmed by loneliness because you miss your family and friends. You may also miss the familiarity of your hometown and your everyday routine.</p>
     <p><strong>3.Expenses</strong>Living abroad may require a sizable amount of money depending on the standard of living in your host country. Apart from admission fees and scholarship, you’ll have plenty of travel, accommodation and other living costs. In addition, if you don’t have health insurance, all the exams and medication can cost you a fortune. Thus, it’s advisable that you have certain health exams before traveling abroad.</p>
     <p><strong>4.Falling behind your studies</strong>While studying abroad will enable you to acquire new knowledge, you risk falling behind with your studies back home. Some universities don’t acknowledge exams taken at foreign universities, which means that you may have to re-sit certain exams. In addition, you may have difficulties catching up with the foreign program you’ve chosen.While studying abroad is a valuable and enriching experience, it also comes with certain disadvantages. Nonetheless, if you feel ready to live and study abroad, no obstacle is insurmountable.
